# Kūpuna Care

Mind-body exercises paired with AI-recommended therapeutic music personalized for dementia patients

## About the Project

Each year, over 55 million people worldwide struggle with cognitive decline, emotional distress, and physical inactivity caused by progressive neurodegeneration. Dementia solutions like memory care, medications, and cognitive therapies offer symptom management but often lack accessibility, affordability, and holistic personalization. These gaps leave many without adequate support for their social, emotional, and physical needs. Our solution combines mind-body exercises like tai chi and yoga with therapeutic music to help people with dementia stay active and improve mood. These low-cost, adaptable routines work for all mobility levels and can be personalized to enhance care. With the potential to serve millions globally, we are seeking partnerships for pilot trials and collaboration with experts to create tailored routines.

## Features

- **Flexibility**: Personalized sessions from 15 to 60 minutes to fit kūpuna needs and caregiver schedules.
- **Accessibility**: Low-cost, low-risk routines for standing, seated, or bedridden subjects.
- **Personalized Music**: AI-generated music playlist tailored to age, gender and race.

## Technical Features

### 2. Create Routine
   - A coach creates a routine by first selecting the routine length and the kūpuna's mobility level. The routine has multiple phases (Warm-Ups, Movements, and Cool-Down). The coach picks one exercise for each phase.

   - Generative AI creates a music playlist tailored to the subject's age, gender and race.
   - The coach enters a routine name and saves the routine.
### 3. Assign Routine
